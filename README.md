reducing traffic congestion

## Problem Statement:
Traffic congestion is the culprit behind improper traffic management, lawlessness on roads and frequent signal failures. While several methods to minimize congestion such as infrared sensors inductive loop detection, video data analysis, wireless sensor networks are in place, they often accompanied by demerits such as high installation and maintenance costs. As a solution, Mobility options offered by ride-hailing services such as Bounce, Uber, Yulu, QuickRide, etc have tried to combat the problem of congestion to a large extent and served road administration and consumers alike.

## Hardware Requirements :
Arduino UNO,Camera module
## SOftware REquirements :
Arduino IDe , Python SDK , CPP Compiler ,APK's,Sensors

## Insatllation Process : 

First WE have to install all the requirements of the camera module.
We have to make the Central hub for ccommuniacation of all tha camera and then communicate with the vehicles.
Then WE have to connect with signals and Timers in the traffic board.
Install OpenCV 

## Causes : 
When vehicles are fully stopped for periods of time, this is colloquially known as a traffic jam or traffic snarl-up. Traffic congestion can lead to drivers becoming frustrated and engaging in road rage.
Mathematically, congestion is usually looked at as the number of vehicles that pass through a point in a window of time, or a flow.

## Idea Implementation:
A highly skilled and smart camera will be designed by the team which is going to be fixed on the traffic signals so that it measures the length of the traffic in a particular direction and provides the relative waiting time to the vehicles in next direction.
The camera is designed with high quality lens with variable focal length.
The camera will also consists of the essential part that will compute the relative waiting time based on calculations done on the length of the traffic.
