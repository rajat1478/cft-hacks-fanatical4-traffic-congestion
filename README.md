reducing traffic congestion

## Problem Statement:
Traffic congestion is the culprit behind improper traffic management, lawlessness on roads and frequent signal failures. While several methods to minimize congestion such as infrared sensors inductive loop detection, video data analysis, wireless sensor networks are in place, they often accompanied by demerits such as high installation and maintenance costs. As a solution, Mobility options offered by ride-hailing services such as Bounce, Uber, Yulu, QuickRide, etc have tried to combat the problem of congestion to a large extent and served road administration and consumers alike.

HArdware Requirements : Arduino UNO,Camera module
SOftware REquirements : Arduino IDe , Python SDK , CPP Compiler ,APK's,Sensors

Insatllation Process : 

First WE have to install all the requirements of the camera module.
We have to make the Central hub for ccommuniacation of all tha camera and then communicate with the vehicles.
Then WE have to connect with signals and Timers in the traffic board.
Install OpenCV
